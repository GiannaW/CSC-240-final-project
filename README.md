Short prose about the project in README.MD
My final project will be a basic  rock paper scissors game. It would either be a sprite that would have an animation of rock paper and scissors. Or an instruction screen that labels each of the rock, paper , scissors  with a number or letter.  The three outputs would be randomly selected from the microcontroller. One button will output the random choice of rock, paper or scissors. The second button will record the amount of points.
